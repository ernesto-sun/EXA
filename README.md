## Background

EXA is the result of years of trying and playing - always keeping one insight in mind that impressed me a lot as teenager. Must have been said by *Sir Charles Antony Richard Hoare* but I cant find the exact refrence:

"An optimized language is the one that can express any fact with the least number of characters,
PLUS the least number of characters needed to describe all exceptions."

Thus, the goal was: Minimzing exceptions while keeping small and simple.

EXA is the one language to rule them all. EXA unites whole chapters, such as: 

* Structure Code
* Function Code
* Data itself
* Database Language
* Semantic language
* Transfer Protocol
* Machine Language
* Pseudocode

This is possible because "Code is Data" and "Data is Code". 

Small languages are great to handle big data. 

Welcome in the age of EXA computing!
